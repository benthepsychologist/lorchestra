# PHI Clinical Detection Configuration
#
# Controls which emails are flagged as clinical in the CONTEXT_EMAILS
# projection and have sender identity redacted.
#
# >>> Update these lists when adding new clinical sources <<<
#
# Three detection signals (OR logic - any match triggers scrubbing):
#   1. Contact table match (automatic - no config needed)
#   2. Clinical sender domains (platforms that send clinical referrals)
#   3. Practice recipient emails (specific mailboxes that receive clinical mail)

# Signal 2: Sender domains for clinical referral platforms.
# Emails FROM these domains are treated as clinical.
# Example: PsychologyToday sends intake inquiries from noreply@psychologytoday.com
clinical_sender_domains:
  - psychologytoday.com

# Signal 3: Specific practice mailboxes that receive clinical correspondence.
# Emails TO any of these addresses are treated as clinical.
# NOTE: These are exact email addresses, NOT domains.
#   drben@benthepsychologist.com != zach@benthepsychologist.com
